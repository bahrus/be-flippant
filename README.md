# be-flippant [WIP]

This package firstly provides a slightly altered version of the [https://github.com/davidkpiano/flipping](flipping) library.  In particular, be-flippant/flipping.js:

1.  Is ES Module friendly.
2.  Allows the functionality to work within a ShadowDOM realm.





Add the [flip](https://github.com/googlearchive/flipjs) behavior to an element declaratively.

```html
<div be-flippant='{
    "duration": 500
}'>
```

Should do whatever [this](https://codesource.io/how-to-use-svelte-flip-animation/) example does.

## Integrating with custom script
