# be-flippant [TODO]

be-flippant first provides a ShadowDOM-friendly version of the [https://github.com/davidkpiano/flipping](flipping) library.  It also allows us to specify the DOM specifiers for the elements to apply the FLIP animation effect to.



Add the [flip](https://github.com/googlearchive/flipjs) behavior to an element declaratively.

```html
<div be-flippant='{
    "duration": 500
}'>
```

Should do whatever [this](https://codesource.io/how-to-use-svelte-flip-animation/) example does.

## Integrating with custom script
